==============
This code was done for Programming 1, year one at The University of Hull.
This was one of the first programs I made in C# so it may have silly errors everywhere.

This is mostly a test to learn how git and github works.

Please note: the coursework required a maximum of 4 players, this has a maximum of 8 players now so this would no longer pass the assesment.
